                        React is an efficient, declarative, predictable and flexible JavaScript library usually used for
                        building UI [user interfaces] (1). It allows you create complex UIs from little and remote
                        pieces of code called “components” (2). Basically, we utilize components to inform React what we
                        want to see on the screen (3). While our data changes, React will efficiently update and
                        re-render our components. (4).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The render method returns a specification of what you want to see on the screen and React takes
                        the specification and displays the result. (5).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Especially, render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to
                        render. (6).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Also, most React developers use a special syntax called “JSX” [also called JavaScript XML] which
                        makes these structures easier to write even we’ll get to the funny XML-like tags soon(7).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And this is why React actually works (8).

                        <strong>Difference between Props and State?</strong>
                    </button>
                </h2>
                <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo"

                        The difference between props and state is given below:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        i) <strong>Key Difference:</strong> Props are external and controlled by whatever renders the
                        component while state is internal and controlled by the component itself.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        ii) <strong>Handle Data:</strong> Props are used to pass data, whereas state is for managing
                        data.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        iii) <strong>Modification:</strong> Data from props is read-only, and cannot be modified by a
                        component that is receiving it from outside but State data can be modified by its own component,
                        (cannot be accessed from outside)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        iv) <strong>Mutability:</strong> Props are immutable while states are mutable.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        v) <strong>Usability:</strong> Props are mostly used to communicate between components, whereas
                        states are used for rendering dynamic changes within component.
